### Challenge
So this is app displays a basic list of Emoji's from an [emoji api](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub)

- Firstly link up the input component so that it limits the amount of visible emoji's
- If the limit is set to 0, then no cards should be visible

#### Bonus challenges

 - Add a Loading component, when the data is being fetched

#### Kerry's Comments
I called the component file I created Progress.js but would normally end it with .jsx.
I would change the update text field to be more styled and not allow negative numbers.
I took under 30 minutes with the first part, with some interruptions. I returned to the bonus part later, after I had performed my Mum's taxi duties :-)
